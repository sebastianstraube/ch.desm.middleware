/**
 * This class allows keeping busy loops at a certain frequency.
 * in case the computation took more than zero time - which is usually
 * the case - the check() function will sleep to reach the configured
 * frequency. In case the computation took longer than the configured
 * frequency, the function will not block, but immediately return.
 * This improves responsiveness of busy loops under load especially.
 *
 * Due to the low resolution of milliseconds, the should not be used
 * for frequencies larger than 100 Hz.
